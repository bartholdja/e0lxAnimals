Determinants of the relationship between the shape and pace of aging
=================================================

Exploring the relationship between the shape of age-specific mortality and the pace of mortality (i.e. length of life).

**Folder structure**

* data: for storing both raw and processed data
* doc: for manuscript
* scr: scripts (init: set wd and load library, input: load/read in data, process: transform data, plot: plot the results)
* misc: miscellaneous 
* out: plots
* 	archived: outdated plots or R-scripts that might be useful to have at hand


There is also an R-project called __paceShape.Rproj__


The misc and doc folder and all files starting with temp do not get stored on github (i.e. they are in the .gitignore with the usual suspects).
